//NOTE: You can send an object back as a response to a POST request or follow up the POST with a GET request to retrieve the data. Using a GET request to follow up is more common at Prime and will put you in a better position working on the History feature below.


EXAMPLE 
History (DOM):
3 * 5 = 15
4 - 2 = 2
4 * 3 = 12
3 + 6 = 9
